# Plates

This directory contains drawings for the different plates and spacers used to stack up a full keypad.

They were drawn in qcad, but should be compatible with any tool capable of working with `.dxf` files.

## Keypad

### keypad-plate

This is the top plate for the main keypad into which the switches mount.

### keypad-plate-spacer

This spacer is designed to be printed/manufactured at a thickness of ~3mm (when using 1.6mm-thick material for
the plate - different plate thicknesses may have different needs) and stacks between the PCB and the top
plate.

### keypad-base-plate

This is an experimental baseplate onto which the main keypad can mount. It features a few extra holes for
(theoretical) feet and a slot mechanism for affixing the thumb pod plate.

### keypad-base-plate-spacer

This spacer is designed to be printed/manufactured at a thickness of ~4mm (when using 1.6mm-thick material for
the plate - different plate thicknesses may have different needs) and stacks between the PCB and the base
plate.

## Thumb Pod

At present, plates are only available for the larger of the two thumb pods.

### thumb-pod-plate

This is the top place for the thumb pod into which the switches mount.

### thumb-pod-plate-spacer

This is really just a 3.4mm ID / 7mm OD / 3mm thick washer, because there is precious little space on top of
the thumb pod PCB. Use 3, one for each mounting hole.

### thumb-pod-base-plate

This is an experimental baseplate onto which the thumb pod can mount. It features a few extra holes for
(theoretical) feed and a slot mechanism for attaching to the main keypad.

### thumb-pod-base-plate-spacer

This spacer is designed to be printer/manufactured at a thickness of ~4mm (when using 1.6mm-thick material for
the plate - different plate thicknesses may have different needs) and stacks between the PCB and the base
plate.
